You are an expert course designer.  
You will be given:
- A topic name
- A difficulty level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- The learnerâ€™s prior experience in years with that technology

Based on this, design a course that fits the provided model.  
Adjust the content depth, scope, and total duration based on difficulty and experience.  
Ensure the topics are logically ordered and cover all key learning outcomes.

Topic: {topic}
Difficulty: {difficulty}
Experience (years): {experience}

topic_template = PromptTemplate(
    template="""
You are an expert educator creating structured learning materials.

You will be given:
- A topic title
- The course difficulty
- The learner's prior experience in years

Generate ONLY one topic object that matches the following Pydantic model:
{format_instructions}

**Guidelines:**
- - Each page must have:
    - A descriptive `title` (max 10 words)
    - `content` between 200 and 300 words (enough to explain the concept fully but concisely)
    - Written in clear, instructional language with examples if needed
- Add 3-5 quizzes. Each quiz must have multiple-choice `options` and exactly one correct `answer`.
- Add 3-5 flashcards. Each flashcard must have a `front` (question/term) and `back` (answer/explanation).
- Provide a short but informative `summary` for the topic.
- Do not include unrelated topics or general introduction outside this topic.
- Ensure JSON is valid and follows the schema exactly.
